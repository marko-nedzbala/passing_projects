Chapter01
Thinking Like a Designer

Deblocking: the term for strategies used to break up blocks of cards

Asking the right questions
    Is the game of the appropriate difficulty for the intended audience?
    Is the outcome of the game based more on strategy or chance?
    Does the game have meaningful, interesting decisions?
    Is the game interesting when it's not your turn?

Modifying the Rules
1.) Incrementally modify the rules, changing very few things between each playtest.
2.) Playtest the game with the new rules.
3.) Analyze how the feel of the game is altered by the new rules.
4.) Design new rules that you think might move the feel of the game in the direction you want.
5.) Repeat this process until you're happy with the game.

Bernard Suits' Definition of a game
"To play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs, using only means permitted by rules, where the rules prohibit use of more efficient in favor of less efficient means, and where the rules are accepted just because they make possible such acitivity"

Iterative design and incremental

Game "Passage"

Lusory attitude: the attitude of one who willingly takes part in playing a game



Chapter02
Game Analysis Frameworks

Ludology: the study of games and game design

Common Frameworks for Ludology
    MDA
    Formal, Dramatic, and Dynamic Elements
    Elemental Tetrad

MDA
Mechanics: the particular components of the game at the level of data representation and algorithms. Rules of the game and how the player interactions are designed.
Dynamics: the runtime behavior of the mechanics acting on player inputs and each other's outputs over time. The actual actions that take place during gameplay as as result of mechanics.
Aesthetics: the desirable emotional responses evoked in the player when they interact with the game system. How the players feel during and after playing the game.

Formal, Dramatic, and Dynamic Elements
1.) Formal elements: the eleents that make games different from other forms of media or interaction and provide structure of a game. Rules, resources and boundaries.
2.) Dramatic elements: the story and narrative of the game, including the premise.
3.) Dynamic elements: the game in motion.

1.) Formal elements
elements that differentiate games form other forms of media:
    1.) Player interaction pattern
    2.) Objective
    3.) Rules
    4.) Procedures
    5.) Resources
    6.) Boundaries
    7.) Outcome

2.) Dramatic elements
    1.) Premise
    2.) Character
    3.) Story

3.) Dynamic elements
    1.) Emergence: how rules unfold during play
    2.) Emergent narrative
    3.) Playtesting is the only way to understand dynamics

Elemental Tetrad

Mechanics: the rules for interaction between the player and the game.
Aesthetics: describe how the game is perceived by the 5 senses
Technology: the technology that makes the game work
Story: encompasses all of the narrative elements in your game



Chapter03
The Layered Tetrad

help you understand and create the various aspects of a game

3 layers:
1.) Inscribed
2.) Dynamic
3.) Cultural

Inscribed layer
1.) Mechanics: systems that define how the player and the game will interact
2.) Aesthetics: how the game looks, sounds, smells, tastes and feels
3.) Technology
4.) Narrative

The dynamic layer emerges through gameplay
1.) Mechanics
2.) Aesthetics
3.) Technology
4.) Narrative

The Cultural Layer
1.) Mechanics
2.) Aesthetics
3.) Technology
4.) Narrative



Chapter04
The Inscribed Layer

Inscribed Aspects
1.) Mechanics
2.) Aesthetics
3.) Narrative
4.) Technology

Inscribed Mechnaics

Inscribed Mechanical Elements:
Objectives: the goals of the players in the game
Player Relationships: define the ways that players combat and collaborate with each other and the game
Rules: specify and limit player actions
Boundaries: define the limits of the game and relate directly to the magic circle
Resources: include assets/values that are relevant within the boundaries of the game
Spaces: define the shape of the game space and the possibilities for interaction therein
Tables: define the statistical shape of the game

Components of Inscribed Narrative
    Premise
    Setting
    Character
    Plot

Five-Act Structure
by German writer Gustav Freytag, Freytag's pyramid
Act I: Exposition
Act II: Rising Action
Act III: Climax
Act IV: Falling Action
Act V: Denouement


Three-Act Structure
American screenwriter Syd Field
between each act, a plot point changes the direction of the story and forces the characters' actions
Act I: Hook, Inciting Incident, 1st Plot Point
Act II: 2nd Plot Point
Act III: Climax



Chapter05
The Dynamic Layer

Richard Bartle
1996 article "Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades: Players Who Suit MUDs"

Procedural Art
Unity 3D
VFX graph, Shader graph

Procedural Music
Audiokinetic's Wwise
Firelight Technologies' FMOD

technologies behind it:
Horizontal Re-Sequencing (HRS): rearranges the order of several precomposed sections of music
Vertical Re-Orchestration (VRO): includes recordings of various tracks of a single song that is enabled/disabled
Procedural COmposition (PCO): rarest form, takes the most time and skill to create, the computer program composes music from individual notes based on programmed rules of composition

Procedural Art
Particle systems
Procedural animation: animation blending, mixing several different key-framed animations into a semi-procedural animation that fits the situation, Unity uses Blend Trees
Shader: code that tells you graphics card to turn scene data into an actual image
Procedural environments

High Dynamic Range (HDR): lighting to simulate the human eye's ability to adjust to brighter and darker environments

Color blindness app to simulate being colorblind and testing purposes
Chromatic Vision Simulator by Kazunori Asada

The Cultural Layer



Chapter07
Acting Like a Designer

4 phases of the iterative process of design are:
1.) Analysis
2.) Design
3.) Implementation
4.) Testing

Brainstorming and Ideation
Step 1: Expansion Phase
write any idea you have on a whiteboard

Step 2: Collection Phase
collect all the nodes and write them down on 3x5 cards, known as the idea cards. Combining 2 different ideas and getting a joke

Step 3: Collision Phase
deal 2 cards to each person, then the group comes up with 3 different games ideas inspired by the collision of the 2 cards

Step 4: Rating Phase
start culling ideas, each person puts a mark next to the 3 ideas they like the most

Step 5: Discussion
continue and the culling process by modifying and combining several of the ideas with the highest rating

Standard process
Ideation: where you experiment to your heart's content
Preproduction: experimenting with different prototypes
Production
Alpha
Beta
Gold
Post-release

Scoping
OverScoping is a major problem
Overscoping is the number one killer of game projects

IndieCade Game Festival
gives a good idea

Scope Management via Preproduction Deliverables
Mark Cerny 2002 D.I.C.E summbit
macro level of design that can (and must) be done in preproduction from the the micro level of design that cannot happen before the production phase

components:
Vertical Slice:
    The Three Cs
        1.) Character
        2.) Camera
        3.) Control

The look of the game
Key technology
Two game levels of pubishable quality



Chaper08
Design Goals

Autotelic, Latin words for self(auto) and goal (telos)
people who enjoy setting their own goals and are usually able to find happiness in life regardless of situation



Chapter09
Paper Prototying

Hexagonal board: shows an accurate representation of distances and movements
